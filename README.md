## 🛡️ Security & Anti-Sharing System

RhyseForge features a state-of-the-art **Device-Locked Subscription System** to prevent unauthorized credential sharing.

- 🔐 **Fingerprint Binding**: Your account is securely bound to your **User ID + Unique Device ID**.
- 🚫 **Anti-Sharing**: Even if someone gets your login credentials, they **cannot access your subscription from another device**.
- 🖥️ **Hardware Signals**: The system uses high-entropy signals (Canvas fingerprint, WebGL GPU renderer, CPU cores, screen resolution, etc.) to identify your machine.
- ⚙️ **Admin Reset**: If you upgrade your device, our admin team can securely reset your binding to allow a transfer.
- 💳 **Manual Payment Verification**: To ensure secure transactions, all purchases go through a manual verification queue where admins confirm payment before activation.
